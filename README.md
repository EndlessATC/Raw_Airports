# EndlessATC/Raw_Airports

[startgrid](https://startgrid.itch.io/), developer of the most excellent game [Endless ATC](https://startgrid.itch.io/endlessatc) (also on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/666610/Endless_ATC/) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dirgtrats.atcradar)) has provided these (roughly) 3000 raw airport configuration files. They're not intended as ready-to-play airports, but more as a starting point to create a new airport file. The files in this collection are automatically composed out of free databases, and the quality and completeness may differ per file. They are intended as a starting point for customized airport configuration files that may be submitted to [EndlessATC/Airports](https://github.com/EndlessATC/Airports) for use by others.
